I (Titto) participated in the [Cybersecurity Awareness Communication Challenge](https://esisar.grenoble-inp.fr/fr/recherche/cybersecurity-awareness-communication-challenge-cac%c2%b2) 2024. Below is the qualification report that allowed me and my teammate Ryan to qualify for the final, which took place at Esisar in Valence.

I'm happy to have represented the TRX name in a competition that was less technical than those we usually play. For more details on the experience and the implementation strategy we used for the final, you can read [my blog post on my personal website](https://tiziano-caruana.github.io/posts/blog/csaw2024/csaw_cac/).

Thank you
