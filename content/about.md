We are a competitive CTF team from Italy.

With the [mhackeroni](https://mhackeroni.it/) joint team we partecipate in top CTFs (like CCC CTF and [DEF CON](https://defcon.org/)).

Many of us are students at Sapienza, University of Rome and alumni of [CyberChallengeIT](https://cyberchallenge.it).

We actively teach crypto, web and binary exploitation at the newbies of Sapienza's CyberChallenge group.
