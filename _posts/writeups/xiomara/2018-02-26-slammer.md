We are given a binary that takes a password as input, sleeps for a couple of seconds and the tells us wether the password is right or wrong.

Since I didn't feel like reversing this jumpy mess, I decided to solve this challenge using the number of memory accesses as an oracle.

I can't remember/find where I saw this technique first, if you have any resources you can leave them in the comments.

I figured out that this binary was just some kind of "fancy" strcmp, so it probably terminated the execution as soon as it found a non matching character.

First of all overwrite the nanosleep syscall with nops to speed up the bruteforce.

Then use the pinatrace [pintool](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool) to count memory reads and writes.

Try each letter, digit and probable symbols keeping the one that leads to most memory operations.

Run this script from source/tools/SimpleExamples/obj-intel64

```python
import string
import subprocess as sp
flag = ''
alphabet = string.ascii_letters + string.digits + '{} _='

for i in range(100):
	cur = 0
	ans = ''
	for j in alphabet:
		# print(j)
		cnt = int(sp.check_output(['sh', '-c', "echo '{}' | '/home/ubuntu/Desktop/pin-3.5-97503-gac534ca30-gcc-linux/pin' -t pinatrace.so -o /proc/self/fd/1 -- ~/Desktop/slammer | wc -l".format(flag + j)]))
		# print(j, cnt)
		if cnt > cur:
			cur = cnt
			ans = j
	flag += ans
	print(flag)
```

This is the count for the first byte
