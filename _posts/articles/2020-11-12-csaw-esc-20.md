This year, we participated for the second time in the [CSAW Embedded Security Challenge](https://www.csaw.io/esc) finals.
This is our final report for the challenge, documenting our approach for all the challenges and the improvements we made to the emulator.

We did it again: just like last year, we completed all the qualifying challenges and the live challenge during the finals.
